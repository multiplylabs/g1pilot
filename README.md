G1Pilot is an open‑source ROS 2 package for Unitree G1 humanoid robots. It exposes two complementary control paths—Joint (low‑level, per‑joint) and Cartesian (end‑effector) and continuously publishes core robot state for monitoring and visualization in RViz.

✳️ Use cases: teleoperation, manipulation research, motion analysis, and integration with higher‑level planners.

## Highlights

- Dual control modes: switch between Joint and Cartesian control on the fly.

- Always‑on telemetry: IMU, odometry, and per‑motor feedback (temperature, voltage, position, velocity).

- RViz‑ready: packaged URDF + RViz config for immediate visualization of the real robot.

- Docker‑first workflow: reproducible build/run scripts for Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble.

- Extensible: clear node boundaries and parameters make it easy to add behaviors or swap planners.

## Pre-requisites
- For visualization, you need to install the [g1pilot](https://github.com/hucebot/g1pilot) package in the same directory as this package.
- Be connected to the robot via WiFi or Ethernet. **It's important to know which interface you are using.**

## Quick Start
### Docker (recommended)
We prepare a docker image to build the package. You can use the following command to build the package, go the `docker` folder and run the following command:

```bash
sh build.sh
```

Then, you can run the docker image with the following command:

```bash
sh run.sh
```

### Package Layout

``` bash
.
├─ g1pilot/                 # Python nodes
├─ description_files/       # URDF/Xacro, meshes
├─ config/                  # RViz and node configs
├─ launch/                  # Launchers (RViz, controllers, state)
├─ docker/                  # Build/run scripts

```

## 🧠 Nodes Overview

**G1Pilot** provides multiple ROS2 nodes to control and monitor the Unitree G1 robot.  
### 3️⃣ Interactive Marker (`interactive_marker`)  
- 🎯 **Purpose:** Publishes a **movable marker in RViz** to interactively control the robot’s end-effector.  
- 🛠️ **Use case:** Intuitive GUI control of the robot without manual command-line inputs.  

### 4️⃣ Robot State (`robot_state`)  
- 🎯 **Purpose:** Publishes the **complete state of the robot**, including:  
  - IMU readings  
  - Odometry  
  - Detailed motor states (temperature, voltage, position, velocity)  
- 🛠️ **Use case:** Used for monitoring and visualization in RViz or other tools.  

### 5️⃣ Loco Client (`loco_client`)  
- 🎯 **Purpose:** Enables **whole-body control and locomotion**, allowing the robot to move using **Unitree’s built-in policy**.  
- 🛠️ **Use case:** Autonomous or manual locomotion commands for walking and navigation.  

### 6️⃣ Joystick (`joystick`)  
- 🎯 **Purpose:** Integrates a **game controller (joystick)** to manually control the robot.  

#### **Basic Controls**
- **L1** → Emergency Stop → The robot enters **Damp Mode** (safe state).
- **⬆️ D-Pad Up** → Switches the robot to **FSM 4**, making it ready to receive commands.
- **R1** → Activates **Balance Mode**.
- **Left Joystick** → Controls **linear movements** (forward, backward, sideways).
- **Right Joystick** → Controls **angular rotation** (turning).
- **Triangle (Toggle)** → Enables/Disables goal navigation mode.
- **X (Toggle)** → Enables/Disables arm control mode.

## Usage
Once you have the docker image running, you can run the following command to start the unitree node:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select g1pilot g1pilot
````

Then, source the workspace:

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```
To visualize the real robot in RViz, you can run the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch g1pilot robot_state_launcher.launch.py
```s

To teleoperate the robot using the joystick, you can run the following command:
```bash
ros2 launch g1pilot teleoperation_launcher.launch.py
```

To apply autonomous navigation, you can run the following command:
```bash
ros2 launch g1pilot navigation_launcher.launch.py
```
